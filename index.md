    <h2>Info regulars know</h2>
    
    <p>Cats, they meow, they stalk, they attack, very sneaky creatures,<br>
      GREAT to make an ally with before they attack you.<br>
      These magical creature have Nine Lives and are very agile when needed to.<br>
      An overall good companion but very lazy and needs lots of pets, food, cat nip, and sleep.<br>
      they are often seen in their natural habitats that is a very sunny place like a window.<br> 
      Very vulurable to scary things like cucumbers and taking baths.</p>
    
    <h2>Music about the Cat</h2>
    
    <p>Everybody wants to be a cat<br>
      Because a cat's the only cat<br>
      Who knows where it's at<br>
      Tell me, everybody's pickin' up on that feline beat<br>
      'Cause everything else is obsolete<br>
      A square with a horn makes you wish you weren't born<br>
